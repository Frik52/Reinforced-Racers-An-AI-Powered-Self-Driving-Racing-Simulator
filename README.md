# Reinforced Racers: An AI-Powered Self-Driving Racing Simulator
A "Self-Driving Car Racing Game" where players train AI drivers using reinforcement learning. Players can customize and train their AI drivers to compete in races, with the AI learning to navigate tracks and improve lap times through trial and error.
Introduction
This project explores the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a dynamic and interactive environment through a self-driving car racing game. In Reinforced Racers, players design, customize, and train AI-controlled racecars that learn to navigate racing tracks via trial and error. The game simulates real-time environments where AI agents continuously adapt and optimize their driving strategies to achieve better performance.
 Project Goal
The main goal is to design a simulation where:

AI agents (racecars) learn to navigate a race track efficiently.

Reinforcement Learning techniques are applied to improve lap times.

Players interact by adjusting hyperparameters and training strategies to compete in races.
Problem Statement
Creating AI that can autonomously learn to drive in a high-speed, rule-based environment poses several challenges, including:

Designing an appropriate state space and action space.

Defining a reward function that encourages both speed and safety.

Ensuring efficient learning using reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning or Deep Q Networks (DQN).
Methodology
4.1 Reinforcement Learning Setup
Agent: The self-driving car.

Environment: The race track simulation.

State: Position, speed, angle, distance to track boundaries, etc.

Actions: Accelerate, decelerate, steer left/right.

Reward Function:

Positive reward for progress on the track.

Negative reward for collisions or going off-track.

Time penalties for inefficient driving.
